# OSTree Utility

## Goals

+ [ ] Make a script to generate an image that can be pulled by any active OSTree system as a deployment.

> ## OSTree in Arch Linux using Podman
> 
> Massive shout-out to [M1cha](https://github.com/M1cha/) for making this possible ([M1cha/archlinux-ostree](https://github.com/M1cha/archlinux-ostree)).
> 
> ### Overview
> 
> This is a helper script which aids in curating your own setup by demonstrating how to:
> 1. Build an immutable OSTree image by using rootfs from a Podman Containerfile.
> 2. Partition and prepare UEFI/GPT disks for a minimal OSTree host system.
> 3. Generate OSTree repository in a empty filesystem.
> 4. Integrate OSTree with GRUB2 bootloader.
> 5. Upgrade an existing OSTree repository with a new rootfs image.
> 
> ### Disk structure
> 
> ```console
> /
> ├── boot
> │   └── efi
> └── ostree
>     ├── deploy
>     │   └── archlinux
>     └── repo
>         ├── config
>         ├── extensions
>         ├── objects
>         ├── refs
>         ├── state
>         └── tmp
> ```
> 
> ### Persistence
> 
> Everything is deleted between deployments **except** for:
> - `/dev` partitions which OSTree does not reside on are untouched.
> - `/etc` only if `--merge` option is specified.
> - `/home` is symlinked to `/var/home` (see below).
> - `/var` data here is mounted from `/ostree/deploy/archlinux/var` to avoid duplication.
> 
> Notes:
> - `/var/cache/podman` is populated _only_ after the first deployment (to avoid including old data from the build machine), this speeds up consecutive builds.
> - `/var/lib/containers` same as above but for Podman layers and images. Base images are updated automatically during `upgrade` command.
> 
> ### Technology stack
> 
> - OSTree
> - Podman with CRUN and Native-Overlayfs
> - GRUB2
> - XFS _(not required)_
> 
> ### Motivation
> 
> My vision is to build a secure and minimal base system which is resilient against breakage and provides setup automation to reduce the burden of doing manual tasks. This can be achieved by:
> 
> - Git.
> - Read-only system files.
> - Restore points.
> - Automatic deployment, installation & configuration.
> - Using only required components like kernel/firmware/driver, microcode and GGC in the base.
> - Doing the rest in temporary namespaces such as Podman.
> 
> ### Goal
> 
> - Reproducible deployments.
> - Versioned rollbacks.
> - Immutable filesystem.
> - Distribution agnostic toolset.
> - Configuration management.
> - Rootfs creation via containers.
> - Each deployment does a factory reset of system's configuration _(unless overridden)_.

> ## Usage
> 
> 1. **Boot into any Arch Linux system:**
> 
>    For instance, using a live CD/USB ISO image from: [Arch Linux Downloads](https://archlinux.org/download).
> 
> 2. **Clone this repository:**
> 
>    ```console
>    $ sudo pacman -Sy git
>    $ git clone https://github.com/GrabbenD/ostree-utility.git && cd ostree-utility
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Find `ID-LINK` for installation device where OSTree image will be deployed:**
> 
>    ```console
>    $ lsblk -o NAME,TYPE,FSTYPE,MODEL,ID-LINK,SIZE,MOUNTPOINTS,LABEL
>    NAME   TYPE FSTYPE MODEL        ID-LINK                                        SIZE MOUNTPOINTS LABEL
>    sdb    disk        Virtual Disk scsi-360022480c22be84f8a61b39bbaed612f         300G
>    ├─sdb1 part vfat                scsi-360022480c22be84f8a61b39bbaed612f-part1   256M             SYS_BOOT
>    ├─sdb2 part xfs                 scsi-360022480c22be84f8a61b39bbaed612f-part2  24.7G             SYS_ROOT
>    └─sdb3 part xfs                 scsi-360022480c22be84f8a61b39bbaed612f-part3   275G             SYS_HOME
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Perform a takeover installation:**
> 
>    **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**
> 
>    `ostree.sh` is destructive and has no prompts while partitioning the specified disk, **proceed with caution**:
> 
>    ```console
>    $ chmod +x ostree.sh
>    $ sudo ./ostree.sh install --dev scsi-360022480c22be84f8a61b39bbaed612f
>    ```
> 
>    ⚙️ Update your BIOS boot order to access the installation.
> 
>    💡 Default login is: `root` / `ostree`
> 
>    💡 Use different Containerfile(s) with `--file FILE1:TAG1,FILE2:TAG2` option
> 
> 5. **Upgrade an existing installation:**
> 
>    While booted into a OSTree system, use:
> 
>    ```console
>    $ sudo ./ostree.sh upgrade
>    ```
> 
>    💡 Use `--merge` option to preserve contents of `/etc`
> 
> 6. **Revert to previous commit:**
> 
>    To undo the latest deployment _(0)_; boot into the previous configuration _(1)_ and execute:
> 
>    ```console
>    $ sudo ./ostree.sh revert
>    ```
> 
> ## Tips
> 
> ### Read-only
> 
> This attribute can be temporarily removed with Overlay filesystem which allows you to modify read-only paths without persisting the changes:
> 
> ```console
> $ ostree admin unlock
> ```
> 
> ### Outdated repository cache
> 
> > `error: failed retrieving file '{name}.pkg.tar.zst' from {source} : The requested URL returned error: 404`
> 
> Your persistent cache is out of sync with upstream, this can be resolved with:
> 
> ```console
> $ ./ostree.sh upgrade --no-podman-cache
> ```
> </details>
